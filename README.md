# Vision for Blind People

We were able to identify the objects and their distances correctly in most cases.
Then using the image tag i.e.”dog” or “truck” and using distance or depth  we can assist the person using the Text_to_Speech library.
Object detection worked in most cases with almost correct accuracy.

There was a bit of confusion when the image was having more than one object and the algorithm seems to be a bit confused in depth estimation.

We were successfully able to do the task using the Stereo Images. Further, we can also improve the program using the Stereo Vision Camera.
